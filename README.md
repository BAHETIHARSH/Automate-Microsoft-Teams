# Automate-Microsoft-Teams

Inspiration:
Without even recognizing it, many of us already interact with automation on a daily basis to simplify everyday tasks. We receive automated order confirmations after placing online orders, use “smart” devices to regulate our thermostat and lock our doors when away from home, or maybe use the parking assist feature on our car. These kinds of automation are infiltrating workplaces and homes at a rapid pace, and the average consumer is quickly experiencing a semi-automated lifestyle in all aspects of their day-to-day lives. Despite all of this, the impact that automation has on education systems is hardly considered — however, automation’s role in education is most definitely a topic for discussion.<br>
	     We can easily log in and attend online classes with this simple automation. this project is created in python language .selenium library is used. pyqt5 is used for GUI. Due to time-lapse many students are unable to join but by this, it will start at the scheduled time.
